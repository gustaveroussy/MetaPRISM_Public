## Data access procedure

### Access to cbioportal

The cbioportal page of the study is publicly available at
<https://cbioportal.gustaveroussy.fr:8081/study/summary?id=metaprism_2023>. You may find in the short description at the
top of the study page a link towards the server where the Data Tables 1 to 12 of all pathogenic germline mutations,
somatic mutations, copy-number segments, gene expression (counts and TPM) and other data tables are made available.

### Access to the EGA dataset

Data access decisions can be passed to the EGA in two ways:
1) By emailing helpdesk@ega-archive.org with the email address of each applicant and confirmation of the dataset/s to
   provide access. EGA will then create an EGA account with the relevant access permissions.
2) By using the EGA DAC Admin tools (available to DAC's dealing with more than 5 data access applications/month).
   Further information on the DAC admin tools and how to access them can be found here:
   https://ega-archive.org/submission/dac/tools

In addition, do not forget to send all the documents needed.
